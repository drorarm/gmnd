# Text To make the page Bigger

Hi Jekyllers,

As you may know, Jekyll is a completely free and open source project. We offer our software and its related plugins and documentation at no cost because we believe that good software should not cost anything. We’re not planning on changing that, but today I want to talk about a different monetary aspect of open source.

Open source developers being paid for the work they do is a rare sight. Most open source software is effectively the result of hundreds and thousands of hours of free labor provided by individuals who are passionate enough to work outside of their day job to create software that, ironically, is being used by almost every company that offers digital services. It’s a problem that has gotten more attention in recent years, with the open source community becoming more diverse and more and more companies actively investing in providing monetary support for open source developers.
